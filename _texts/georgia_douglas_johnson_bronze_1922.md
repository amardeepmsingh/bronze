## Author Note

This book is the child of a bitter earth-wound. I sit on the earth and sing —  sing out, and of, my sorrow. Yet, fully conscious of the potent agencies that silently work in their healing ministries, I know that God's sun shall one day shine upon a perfected and unhampered people.

## Foreword by W.E.B. DuBois

Those who know what it means to be a colored woman in 1922 — and know it not so much in fact as in feeling, apprehension, unrest and delicate yet stern thought — must read Georgia Douglas Johnson's Bronze. Much of it will not touch this reader and that, and some of it will mystify and puzzle them as a sort of reiteration and over-emphasis. But none can fail to be caught here and there by a word — a phrase — a period that tells a life history or even paints the history of a generation.  Can you not see that marching of the mantled with  

       "Voices strange to ecstasy?" 

Have you ever looked on the "twilight faces" of their throngs, or seen the black mother with her son when 

       "Her heart is sandaling his feet?" 

Or can you not conceive that infinite sorrow of a dark child wandering the world:  
       
       "Seeking the breast of an unknown face!" 

I hope Mrs. Johnson will have wide reading. Her word is simple, sometimes trite, but it is singularly sincere and true, and as a revelation of the soul struggle of the women of a race it is invaluable. 

W. E. B. Du BOIS. 
New York, August 4, 1922.

## EXHORTATION

---

## SONNET TO THE MANTLED

- And they shall rise and cast their mantles by, 
- Erect and strong and visioned, in the day 
- That rings the knell of Curfew o'er the sway 
- Of prejudice — who reels with mortal cry 
- To lift no more her leprous, blinded eye. 
- Reft of the fetters, far more cursed than they 
- Which held dominion o'er human clay. 
- The spirit soars aloft where rainbows lie. 

- Like joyful exiles swift returning home — 
- The rhythmic chanson of their eager feet. 
- While voices strange to ecstasy, long dumb. 
- Break forth in major rhapsodies, full sweet. 
- Into the very star-shine, lo! they come 
- Wearing the bays of victory complete! 

---


## SONNET TO THOSE WHO SEE BUT DARKLY 

- Their gaze uplifting from shoals of despair 
- Like phantoms groping enswathed from the light 
- Up from miasmic depths, children of night, 
- Surge to the piping of Hope's dulcet lay, 
- Souled like the lily, whose splendors declare 
- God's mazèd paradox — purged of all blight. 
- Out from the quagmire, unsullied and fair. 

- Life holds her arms o'er the festering way, 
- Smiles, as their faith-sandalled rushes prevail, 
- Slowly the sun rides the marge of the day. 
- Wine to the lips sorely anguished and pale; 
- On, ever on, do the serried ranks sway 
- Charging the ultimate, rending the veil. 



---

## BROTHERHOOD 

- Come, brothers all! 
- Shall we not wend 
- The blind-way of our prison-world 
- By sympathy entwined? 
- Shall we not make 
- The bleak way for each other's sake 
- Less rugged and unkind? 
- O let each throbbing heart repeat 
- The faint note of another's beat 
- To lift a chanson for the feet 
- That stumble down life's checkered street.

---

## SUPPLICATION

---

## LET ME NOT LOSE MY DREAM 

- Let me not lose my dream, e'en though I scan the veil 
- {:.indent-3}with eyes unseeing through their glaze of tears, 
- Let me not falter, though the rungs of fortune perish 
- {:.indent-3}as I fare above the tumult, praying purer air, 
- Let me not lose the vision, gird me. Powers that toss 
- {:.indent-3}the worlds, I pray! 
- Hold me, and guard, lest anguish tear my dreams 
- {:.indent-3}away! 


---

## LET ME NOT HATE 

- Let me not hate, although the bruising world decries 
- {:.indent-3}my peace, 
- Gives me no quarter, hounds me while I sleep; 
- Would snuff the candles of my soul and sear my inmost 
- {:.indent-3}dreamings. 

- Let me not hate, though girt by vipers, green and hiss- 
- {:.indent-3}ing through the dark; 

- I fain must love. God help me keep the altar-gleams 
- {:.indent-3}that flicker wearily, anon, 

- On down the world's grim night! 


---


## CALLING DREAMS 

- The right to make my dreams come true 
- I ask, nay, I demand of life, 
- Nor shall fate's deadly contraband 
- Impede my steps, nor countermand. 

- Too long my heart against the ground 
- Has beat the dusty years around, 
- And now, at length, I rise, I wake! 
- And stride into the morning-break ! 


--- 

## DESIRE 

- Ope! ye everlasting doors, unto my soul's demand, 
- I would go forward, fare beyond these dusty boulevards, 
- Faint lights and fair allure me all insistently 
- And I must stand within the halls resplendent, of my dreams. 



--- 

## SHADOW 

--- 


## SORROW SINGERS 

- Hear their viol-voices ringing 
- {:.indent-3}Down the corridor of years, 
- As they lift their twilight faces 
- {:.indent-3}Through a mist of falling tears ! 

---
 
## THE CROSS 

- All day the world's mad mocking strife, 
- The venomed prick of probing knife, 
- The baleful, subtle leer of scorn 
- That rims the world from morn to morn, 
- While reptile-visions writhe and creep 
- Into the very arms of sleep 
- To quench the fitful burnished gleams: 
- A crucifixion in my dreams! 


---

## PREJUDICE 

- These fell miasmic rings of mist, with ghoulish menace 
- {:.indent-3}bound, 
- Like noose-horizons tightening my little world around, 
- They still the soaring will to wing, to dance, to speed 
- {:.indent-3}away. 
- And fling the soul insurgent back into its shell of clay: 

- Beneath incrusted silences, a seething Etna lies. 
- The fire of whose furnaces may sleep — but never dies! 


---

## LAOCOÖN 

- This spirit-choking atmosphere 
- {:.indent-3}With deadly serpent-coil 
- Entwines my soaring-upwardness 
- {:.indent-3}And chains me to the soil, 
- Where'er I seek with eager stride 
- {:.indent-3}To gain yon gleaming height, 
- These noisesome fetters coil aloft 
- {:.indent-3}And snare my buoyant flight. 

- O, why these aspirations bold, 
- {:.indent-3}These rigours of desire. 
- That surge within so ceaselessly 
- {:.indent-3}Like living tongues of fire? 
- And why these glowing forms of hope 
- {:.indent-3}That scintillate and shine, 
- If naught of all that burnished dream 
- {:.indent-3}Can evermore be mine? 
- It cannot be, fate does not mock, 
- {:.indent-3}And man's untoward decree 
- Shall not forever thus confine 
- {:.indent-3}My life's entirety, 
- My every fibre fierce rebels 
- {:.indent-3}Against this servile role, 
- And all my being broods to break 
- {:.indent-3}This death-grip from my soul! 


---

## MOODS 

- My heart is pregnant with a great despair 
- With much beholding of my people's care, 
- 'Mid blinded prejudice and nurtured wrong, 
- Exhaling wantonly the days along: 
- I mark Faith's fragile craft of cheering light 
- Tossing imperiled on the sea of night, 
- And then, enanguished, comes my heart's low cry, 
- "God, God! I crave to learn the reason why!" 
- Again, in spirit loftily I soar 
- With winged vision through earth's outer door. 
- In such an hour, it is mine to see, 
- In frowning fortune smiling destiny! 


--- 

## HEGIRA 

- Oh, black man, why do you northward roam, and leave 
- {:.indent-3}all the farm lands bare? 
- Is your house not warm, tightly thatched from storm, 
- {:.indent-3}and a larder replete your share? 
- And have you not schools, fit with books and tools the 
- {:.indent-3}steps of your young to guide? 
- Then what do you seek, in the north cold and bleak, 
- {:.indent-3}'mid the whirl of its teeming tide? 

- I have toiled in your cornfields, and parched in the sun, 
- {:.indent-3}I have bowed 'neath your load of care, 
- I have patiently garnered your bright golden grain, in 
- {:.indent-3}season of storm and fair. 
- With a smile I have answered your glowering gloom, 
- {:.indent-3}while my wounded heart quivering bled. 
- Trailing mute in your wake, as your rosy dawn breaks, 
- {:.indent-3}while I curtain the mound of my dead. 

- Though my children are taught in the schools you have 
- {:.indent-3}wrought, they are blind to the sheen of the sky, 
- For the brand of your hand, casts a pall o'er the land, 
- {:.indent-3}that enshadows the gleam of the eye. 
- My sons, deftly sapped of the brawn-hood of man, self- 
- {:.indent-3}rejected and impotent stand, 

- My daughters, unhaloed, unhonored, undone, feed the 	
- {:.indent-3}lust of a dominant land. 

- I would not remember, yet could not forget, how the 
- {:.indent-3}hearts beating true to your own. 
- You've tortured, and wounded, and filtered their blood 
- {:.indent-3}'till a budding Hegira has blown. 

- Unstrange is the pathway to Calvary's hill, which I 
- {:.indent-3}wend in my dumb agony, 
- Up its perilous height, in the pale morning light, to 
- {:.indent-3}dissever my own from the tree. 

- And so I'm away, where the sky-line of day sets the 
- {:.indent-3}arch of its rainbow afar, 
- To the land of the north, where the symbol of worth 
- {:.indent-3}sets the broad gates of combat ajar! 



---

## THE PASSING OF THE EX-SLAVE 

- Swift melting into yesterday, 
- The tortured hordes of ebon-clay; 
- No more is heard the plaintive strain, 
- The rhythmic chaunting of their pain. 

- Their mounded bodies dimly rise 
- To fill the gulf of sacrifice, 
- And o'er their silent hearts below 
- The mantled millions softly go. 

- Some few remaining still abide. 
- Gnarled sentinels of time and tide. 
- Now mellowed by a chastened glow 
- Which lighter hearts will never know. 

- Winding into the silent way, 
- Spent with the travail of the day, 
- So royal In their humble might 
- These uncrowned Pilgrims of the Night! 


---

## THE OCTOROON 

- One drop of midnight in the dawn of life's pulsating 
- {:.indent-3}stream 
- Marks her an alien from her kind, a shade amid its 
- {:.indent-3}gleam; 
- Forevermore her step she bends insular, strange, 
- {:.indent-3}apart — 
- And none can read the riddle of her wildly warring 
- {:.indent-3}heart. 

- The stormy current of her blood beats like a mighty sea 
- Against the man-wrought iron bars of her captivity. 
- For refuge, succor, peace and rest, she seeks that 
- {:.indent-3}humble fold 
- Whose every breath is kindliness, whose hearts are 
- {:.indent-3}purest gold. 


---

## ALIENS 

- (To You — Everywhere! Dedicated) 

- They seem to smile as others smile, the masquerader's 
- {:.indent-3}art 
- Conceals them, while, in verity, they're eating out their 
- {:.indent-3}heart. 
- Betwixt the two contending stones of crass humanity 
- They lie, the fretted fabric of a dual dynasty. 

- A single drop, a sable strain debars them from their 
- {:.indent-3}own,-— 
- The others — fold them furtively, but God! they are 
- {:.indent-3}alone. 
- Blown by the fickle winds of fate far from the traveled 
- {:.indent-3}mart 
- To die, when they have quite consumed the morsel of 
- {:.indent-3}their heart. 
- When man shall lift his lowered eyes to meet the moon 
- {:.indent-3}of truth, 
- Shall break the shallow shell of pride and wax in ways 
- {:.indent-3}of ruth, 
- He cannot hate, for love shall reign untrammelled in 
- {:.indent-3}the soul, 
- While peace shall spread a rainbow o'er the earth from 
- {:.indent-3}pole to pole. 


--- 

## CONCORD 



- Nor shall I in sorrow repine, 
- But offer a paean of praise 
- To the infinite God of my days 
- Who marshals the pivoting spheres 
- Through the intricate maze of the years, 
- Who loosens the luminous flood 
- That lightens the purlieus of men, 
- I shall not in sorrow repine 
- To break the eternal Amen! 


---

## MOTHERHOOD

--- 

## THE MOTHER 

- The mother soothes her mantled child 
- With incantation sad and wild; 
- A deep compassion brims her eye 
- And stills upon her lips, the sigh. 

- Her thoughts are leaping down the years, 
- O'er branding bars, through seething tears, 
- Her heart is sandaling his feet 
- Adown the world's corroding street. 

- Then, with a start she dons a smile 
- His tender yearnings to beguile. 
- And only God will ever know 
- The wordless measure of her woe. 

---

## MATERNITY 

- Proud? 
- Perhaps— and yet 
- I cannot say with surety 
- That I am happy thus to be 
- Responsible for this young life's embarking. 
- Is he not thrall to prevalent conditions? 
- Does not the day loom dark apace 
- To weave its cordon of disgrace 
- Around his lifted throat? 
- Is not this mezzotint enough and surfeit 
- For such prescience? 
- Ah, did I dare 
- Recall the pulsing life I gave, 
- And fold him in the kindly grave ! 

- Proud? 
- Perhaps — could I but ever so faintly scan 
- The broad horizon of a man 
- Swept fair for his dominion — 
- So hesitant and half-afraid 
- I view this babe of sorrow! 


---

## BLACK WOMAN 

- Don't knock at my door, little child, 
- {:.indent-3}I cannot let you in. 
- You know not what a world this is 
- {:.indent-3}Of cruelty and sin. 
- Wait in the still eternity 
- {:.indent-3}Until I come to you, 
- The world is cruel, cruel, child, 
- {:.indent-3}I cannot let you in! 

- Don't knock at my heart, little one, 
- {:.indent-3}I cannot bear the pain 
- Of turning deaf-ear to your call 
- {:.indent-3}Time and time again! 
- You do not know the monster men 
- {:.indent-3}Inhabiting the earth. 
- Be still, be still, my precious child, 
- {:.indent-3}I must not give you birth! 



---	

## "ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE, MY LITTLE ONE'' 

- The infant eyes look out amazed upon the frowning 
- {:.indent-3}earth, 
- A stranger, in a land now strange, child of the mantled- 
- {:.indent-3}birth; 

- Waxing, he wonders more and more; the scowling grows 
- {:.indent-3}apace; 
- A world, behind its barring doors, reviles his ebon face: 

- Yet from this maelstrom issues forth a God-like entity. 
- That loves a world all loveless, and smiles on Calvary! 

---

## SHALL I SAY, "MY SON, YOU'RE BRANDED"? 

- Shall I say, "My son, you're branded in this country's 
- {:.indent-3}pageantry, 
- By strange subtleties you're tethered, and no forum 
- {:.indent-3}sets you free?" 
- Shall I mark the young lights fading through your soul- 
- {:.indent-3}enchannelled eye, 
- As the dusky pall of shadows screen the highway of 
- {:.indent-3}your sky? 

- Or shall I, with love prophetic, bid you dauntlessly 
- {:.indent-3}arise. 
- Spurn the handicap that clogs you, taking what the 
- {:.indent-3}world denies, 
- Bid you storm the sullen fortress wrought by prejudice 
- {:.indent-3}and wrong 
- With a faith that shall not falter, in your heart and on 
- {:.indent-3}your tongue! 

---


## MY BOY 

- I hear you singing happily, 
- {:.indent-3}My boy of tarnished mien, 
- Lifting your limpid, trustful gaze 
- {:.indent-3}In innocence serene. 

- A thousand javelins of pain 
- {:.indent-3}Assault my heaving breast 
- When I behold the storm of years 
- {:.indent-3}That beat without your nest. 

- O sing, my lark, your matin song 
- {:.indent-3}Of joyous rhapsody, 
- Distil the sweetness of the hours 
- {:.indent-3}In gladsome ecstasy. 

- For time awaits your buoyant flight 
- {:.indent-3}Across the bar of years. 
- Sing, sing your song, my bonny lark, 
- {:.indent-3}Before it melts in tears! 

---

## GUARDIANSHIP 

- That dusky child upon your knee 
- Is breath of God's eternity; 
- Direct his vision to the height — 
- Let naught obscure his royal right. 

- Although the highways to renown 
- Are iron-barred by fortune's frown, 
- 'Tis his to forge the master-key 
- That wields the locks of destiny 1 

---

## UTOPIA 

- God grant you wider vision, clearer skies, my son, 
- With morning's rosy kisses on your brow; 
- May your wild yearnings know repose, 
- And storm-clouds break to smiles 
- As you sweep on with spreading wings 
- Unto a waiting sunset! 

---

## LITTLE SON 

- The very acme of my woe, 
- {:.indent-3}The pivot of my pride, 
- My consolation, and my hope 
- {:.indent-3}Deferred, but not denied. 
- The substance of my every dream, 
- {:.indent-3}The riddle of my plight, 
- The very world epitomized 
- {:.indent-3}In turmoil and delight. 


---

## BENEDICTION 

- Go forth, my son, 
- Winged by my heart's desire! 
- Great reaches, yet unknown, 
- Await 
- For your possession. 
- I may not, if I would. 
- Retrace the way with you, 
- My pilgrimage is through, 
- But life is calling you! 
- Fare high and far, my son, 
- A new day has begun. 
- Thy star-ways must be won! 


--- 

## PRESCIENCE

---

## CREDO 

- I believe in the ultimate justice of Fate; 
- That the races of men front the sun in their turn; 
- That each soul holds the title to infinite wealth 
- In fee to the will as it masters itself; 
- That the heart of humanity sounds the same tone 
- In impious jungle, or sky-kneeling fane. 
- I believe that the key to the life-mystery 
- Lies deeper than reason and further than death. 
- I believe that the rhythmical conscience within 
- Is guidance enough for the conduct of men. 

---

## PROMISE 

- Through the moil and the gloom they have issued 
- {:.indent-3}To the steps of the upwinding hill, 

- Where the sweet, dulcet pipes of tomorrow 
- {:.indent-3}In their preluding rhapsodies trill. 

- With a thud comes a stir in the bosom, 
- {:.indent-3}As there steals on the sight from afar, 

- Through a break of a cloud's coiling shadow 
- {:.indent-3}The gleam of a bright morning star! 

---

## THE SUPPLIANT 

- Long have I beat with timid hands upon life's leaden 
- {:.indent-3}door, 
- Praying the patient, futile prayer my fathers prayed 
- {:.indent-3}before, 
- Yet I remain without the close, unheeded and unheard, 
- And never to my listening ear is borne the waited word. 

- Soft o'er the threshold of the years there comes this 
- {:.indent-3}counsel cool: 
- The strong demand, contend, prevail; the beggar is a 
- {:.indent-3}fool! 

---

## HOPE 

- Frail children of sorrow, dethroned by a hue, 
- The shadows are flecked by the rose sifting through, 
- The world has its motion, all things pass away. 
- No night is omnipotent, there must be day. 

- The oak tarries long in the depth of the seed, 
- But swift is the season of nettle and weed. 
- Abide yet awhile in the mellowing shade. 
- And rise with the hour for which you were made. 

- The cycle of seasons, the tidals of man 
- Revolve in the orb of an infinite plan. 
- We move to the rhythm of ages long done, 
- And each has his hour — to dwell in the sun! 


--- 

## EXALTATION

---

## COSMOPOLITE 

- Not wholly this or that, 
- But wrought 
- Of alien bloods am I, 
- A product of the interplay 
- Of traveled hearts. 
- Estranged, yet not estranged, I stand 
- All comprehending; 
- From my estate 
- I view earth's frail dilemma; 
- Scion of fused strength am I, 
- All understanding, 
- Nor this nor that 
- Contains me. 


---

## FUSION 

- How deftly does the gardener blend 
- This rose and that 
- To bud a new creation, 
- More gorgeous and more beautiful 
- Than any parent portion, 
- And so, 
- I trace within my warring blood 
- The tributary sources, 
- They potently commingle 
- And sweep 
- With new-born forces! 


---

## PERSPECTIVE 

- Some day 
- I shall be glad that it was mine to be 
- A dark fore-runner of a race burgeoning; 
- I then shall know 
- The secret of life's Calvary, 
- And bless the thorns 
- That wound me! 


---

## WHEN I RISE UP 

- When I rise above the earth, 
- And look down on the things that fetter me, 
- I beat my wings upon the air. 
- Or tranquil lie, 
- Surge after surge of potent strength 
- Like incense comes to me 
- When I rise up above the earth 
- And look down upon the things that fetter me. 

---

## FAITH 

- The faint lose faith 
- When in the tomb their all is laid, 
- And there returns 
- No echoing of weal or woe. 
- The strong hope on, 
- They see the clods close over head, 
- The grass grow green. 
- No word is said. 
- And yet — 
- A little world within the world 
- Are we, 
- Daily our hearts' high yearnings fade, 
- Are buried! 
- New ones are made, — 
- Are crucified! 
- And yet — 

----

## MARTIAL

---

## WE FACE THE FUTURE 

- The hour Is big with sooth and sign, with errant men 
- {:.indent-3}at war, 
- While blood of alien, friend, and foe imbues the land 
- {:.indent-3}afar, 
- And we, with sable faces pent, move with the vanguard 
- {:.indent-3}line. 
- Shod with a faith that Springtime keeps, and all the 
- {:.indent-3}stars opine. 

--- 

## SOLDIER 

- Though I should weep until the judgment, 
- How would it serve — 
- Brave men are fighting, women speed them, 
- 'Tis a day 
- Of crucial conflict! 
- My son, sometimes it seems I'd rather hold 
- You safe beneath my heart 
- Than send you forth! 
- But lo! The sun is red and weaker children go! 
- Though I should weep until the judgment. 
- Bow would it serve! 
- I'll close my eyes and smile, O Son of Mine, 
- Your cause is kingly! 
- Step proud and confident, worthy your mother; 
- Be firm and brave, O Son of Mine, be strong. 
- For terror waxeth, 
- Speed swift away. 
- Though I should weep until the judgment . . .

## HOMING BRAVES 

- There's music in the measured tread 
- Of those returning from the dead 
- Like scattered flowers from a plain 
- So lately crimson, with the slain. 

- No more the sound of shuffled feet 
- Shall mark the poltroon on the street, 
- Nor shifting, sodden, downcast eye 
- Reveal the man afraid to die. 

- They shall have paid full, utterly 
- The price of peace across the sea, 
- When, with uplifted glance, they come 
- To claim a kindly welcome home. 

- Nor shall the old-time daedal sting 
- Of prejudice, their manhood wing. 
- Nor heights, nor depths, nor living streams 
- Stand in the pathway of their dreams!

## TAPS 

<p><img src="bronze/assets/georgia douglas johnson Poem To Samuel Coleridge Taylor illustration.png" /></p>

- They are embosomed in the sod, 
- {:.indent-3}In still and tranquil leisure, 
- Their lives they've cast like trifles down, 
- {:.indent-3}To serve their country's pleasure. 

- Nor bugle call, nor mother's voice. 
- {:.indent-3}Nor moody mob's unreason, 
- Shall break their solace and repose 
- {:.indent-3}Through swiftly changing season. 

- O graves of men who lived and died 
- {:.indent-3}Afar from life's high pleasures, 
- Fold them in tenderly and warm 
- {:.indent-3}With manifold fond measures. 

---

## PEACE 

- Peace on a thousand hills and dales, 
- {:.indent-3}Peace in the hearts of men 
- While kindliness reclaims the soil 
- {:.indent-3}Where bitterness has been. 

- The night of strife is drifting past, 
- {:.indent-3}The storm of shell has ceased. 
- Disrupted is the cordon fell, 
- {:.indent-3}Sweet charity released. 

- Forth from the shadow, swift we come 
- {:.indent-3}Wrought in the flame together. 
- All men as one beneath the sun 
- {:.indent-3}In brotherhood forever.

## Random

---

## QUESTION 

- Where are the brave men, where are the strong men? 
- Pygmies rise 
- And spawn the earth. 
- Weak-kneed, weak-hearted, and afraid, 
- Afraid to face the counsel of their timid hearts, 
- Afraid to look men squarely, 
- Down they gaze — 
- With fatal fascination 
- Down, down — 
- Into the whirling maggot sands 
- Of prejudice. 

---

## THE INITIATE 

- The woes of flesh are naught 
- To one who knows 
- The agony of soul! 
- 'Twere but the thud of wind and rain 
- Upon the roof. 
- The woes of flesh are naught 
- To one who knows! 



## BONDAGE 

- Many cages round me, 
- Bar on bar 
- Stand grim, forbidding! 
- Ghostly pressures 
- Clutch my heart. 
- I gaze with eyes unseeing — 
- Whereunto may I wander free? 
- Alas, alas! 
- My garden walks lie inwardly! 

---

## RESOLUTION 

- With but one life full certified, 
- And that of every gleam denied 
- My portion, 
- Close to the unrelenting sod. 
- E'en as my fathers dumbly trod, 
- I've slumbered; 
- But now a surging, wild unrest 
- Uproots the poppies from my breast, 
- My soul awake, erect! anew! 
- I stand and face the star-swept blue, 
- And swear to make my dreams come true! 

---

## ECLIPSE 

- Aflounder the uncompassed darkness of doubt 
- {:.indent-3}In search of the path to the goal 
- That lies at the end of our transient day, 
- {:.indent-3}The ultimate bourne of the soul; 
- I grasp into nothingness, feebly essay 
- {:.indent-3}To clasp but a willow, a stone, 
- And grope through the stepless, unechoing gloom 
- {:.indent-3}Unanswered, unsuccored, alone! 

---

## WHY 

- The verdure sleeps in winter, 
- {:.indent-3}Awakes with April rain, 
- The sun swings low — 'tis night — ascends, 
- {:.indent-3}And lo! 'tis morn again: 
- The world spins on triumphant 
- {:.indent-3}Across a trackless sky, 
- And man seeks evermore in vain 
- {:.indent-3}The primal reason why. 

- O whither are we rushing? 
- {:.indent-3}And wherefrom were we torn? 
- We breathe from out the silences, 
- {:.indent-3}And breathless, back are borne. 

- Deep in the soul are voices 
- {:.indent-3}Returning this reply: 
- It took a God to make us. 
- {:.indent-3}Only God can answer why! 

---

## HUSKS 

- Forever and forevermore, 
- {:.indent-3}Across the heights, the deeps, 
- Spurred by an ever-flaming zeal 
- {:.indent-3}That slumbers not, nor sleeps — 
- We chase the furtive form of fame 
- {:.indent-3}Beyond the edge of dusk, 
- To bear within our arms at length, 
- {:.indent-3}An empty mocking, husk! 

---

## THE WATCHER 

- The long, grim years with iron tread 
- {:.indent-3}Move down the shuttered isle 
- Of time's unrecking labyrinth 
- {:.indent-3}Paved with forgotten dead. 

- And I, a feather in their wake, 
- {:.indent-3}Gaze long and tremblingly 
- Into these sunless corridors, 
- {:.indent-3}Praying the light to break! 

---

## THE VANISHED ROAD 

- We're wending the trail of the vanishing road, 
- With a song and a shout, just to lighten the load, 
- That lies in the heart, filled with queries and cares, 
- For never a traveler knows where he fares. 

- But on with a jest, and rollicksome cheer, 
- With laughter that leaps, as a veil, for the tear; 
- The world's weary caravan finds that abode 
- That lies at the end of the vanishing road. 

---

## Appreciations 
---

## SERVICE 

- When we count out our gold at the end of the day, 
- And have filtered the dross that has cumbered the way, 
- Oh, what were the hold of our treasury then 
- Save the love we have shown to the children of men? 

---

## TO THE MARTYRED 

- O sacrificial throng whose lives 
- {:.indent-3}Build up the yawning deeps 
- O'er which we pass reflectively 
- {:.indent-3}To broader lights and sweeps. 

- Know, that we hold with reverence 
- {:.indent-3}The signal price you paid, 
- And all our trophies, one by one, 
- {:.indent-3}Upon your bier are laid. 

---

## TO JOHN BROWN 

- We lift a song to you across the day 
- Which bears through travailing the seed you spread 
- In terror's morning, flung with fingers red 
- In blood of tyrants, who debarred the way 
- To Freedom's dawning. Hearken to the lay 
- Chanted by dusky millions, soft and mellow-keyed, 
- In minor measure. Martyr of the Freed, 
- A song of memory across the day. 

- Truth cannot perish though the earth erase 
- The royal signals, leaving not a trace. 
- And time still burgeoneth the fertile seed, 
- Though he is crucified who wrought the deed: 
- O Alleghanies, fold him to your breast 
- Until the judgment! Sentinel his rest! 

---

## TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN 

- Within the temple of our heart 
- Your sacred memory dwells apart, 
- Where ceaselessly a censor swings 
- Alight with fragrant offerings; 
- Nor time, nor tide, nor circumstance 
- Can dim this grand remembrance, 
- And all the blood of Afric hue 
- Beats in one mighty tide — for you! 

---

## TO WILLIAM STANLEY BRAITHWAITE 

- When time has rocked the present age to sleep, 
- And lighter hearts are lilting to the sway 
- Of rhythmic poesy's enhanced lay, 
- Recurring sequences shall fitly keep 
- Your fame eternal, as they lightly sweep 
- Aside the curtain to that potent day 
- When you in primal fervor led the way 
- Unto Apollo's narrow winding steep. 

- None shall forget your travail, utter, sore. 
- That oped the golden avenue of song, 
- When, like a knight, so errantly you bore 
- The mantled children valiantly along. 
- Their homage as a rising incense sweet 
- Shall permeate the heavens at your feet! 

---

## TO W. E. B. DuBois— Scholar

- Grandly isolate as the god of day — 
- Blazing an orbit through the dank and gloom 
- Of misty morning, far and fair you loom, 
- Flooding the dimness with your golden ray, — 
- Cheering the mantled on the thorn-set way, 
- Teaching of Faith and Hope o'er the tomb. 
- Where both, though buried, spring to newer bloom- 
- Strengthened and sweet from the mound of decay. 

- Soft! strains of Sanctus we lift on the air. 
- Ere Nunc Dimittus at last shall be sung. 
- Sing we our Sanctus to fitly declare 
- Blessings that well up from hearts sorely wrung. 

- Lead, lead us on o'er the furthermost stair — 
- Light of our impotence! Joy of our tongue! 

---

## TO RIDGELY TORRENCE— PLAYWRIGHT 

- All hail! fair vistas break upon the view, 
- The gates swing wide and free with clanging sound, 
- Rejoice! a mighty champion is found, 
- Son of the morning, prescient and true. 
- Upon the threshold of a cycle new 
- He stands, and sentinels its virgin ground. 
- Seer in his poet-visioning profound. 
- Presaging vaster reaches — skies more blue. 

- Lifting their misty glances to the day, 
- The prismic children pass the erstwhile bars. 
- Exultant, swiftly, boundlngly they stray. 
- Awhile forgetful of deep, hidden scars 
- Thus, as a golden legend time shall tell 
- Of him who wrought so mightily and well! 


---

## TO RICHARD R. WRIGHT— INSTRUCTOR 

- Son of a race, whose dusky visage shows 
- The heel of fortune, those who walk unfree 
- Though cradled in the hold of liberty, 
- Whose shackled spirit every gamut knows 
- Of Hate's cadenza, through whose v/arm blood flows 
- The royal ransom of love's dynasty. 
- Scion of these, he strides to meet his foes. 
- Erect, unbending, note his sable brow, 
- The rugged furrows where deep feelings plough, 
- The step of vigor and the noble air, 
- The subtle halo of his wintry hair. 
- Up from the furnace of the Earth's red sea 
- A man is fashioned for the years to be !

## TO SAMUEL COLERIDGE TAYLOR, UPON HEARING HIS 


<p><img src="https://github.com/amardeepmsingh/bronze/blob/gh-pages/assets/georgia%20douglas%20johnson%20Poem%20To%20Samuel%20Coleridge%20Taylor%20illustration.png" /></p>

- Strange to a sensing motherhood, 
- Loved as a toy — not understood, 
- Child of a dusky father, bold; 
- Frail little captive, exiled, cold. 

- Oft when the brooding planets sleep, 
- You through their drowsy empires creep, 
- Flinging your arms through their empty space, 
- Seeking the breast of an unknown face. 


---

## TO EMILIE BIGELOW HAPGOOD — PHILANTHROPIST 

- Far from the seried ranks you sway, 
- {:.indent-3}Firm in your own believing 
- In that frail brotherhood, who stray 
- {:.indent-3}Sore anguishing, sore grieving. 
- Such hands as yours, adown the years 
- {:.indent-3}Enchain a faith unbroken, 
- They stay the dreary waste of tears, 
- {:.indent-3}And lift to Hope a token! 


---

## TO HENRY LINCOLN JOHNSON — LAWYER 

- Quite firmly did you stand, and unafraid 
- Before that haughty bar that sought to hold 
- You fettered, lest you strengthen and grow bold 
- To break a clearing through that fetid glade 
- Which their benighted prejudice had made; 
- They taunted you with darkling hints of gold. 
- Preferring you were bought as you had sold, 
- They weaved their webs like spiders in the shade. 

- But as a giant in the falling night 
- Of storm, you forged afore with ruthless tread. 
- To offer up your heart's blood in the fight, 
- Forgetting self, unmindful, unafraid, 
- Nor pausing until thrice acclaimed the right 
- To rally in the tents of those you led. 


---

## TO MARY CHURCH TERRELL — LECTURER 

- A pioneer, she blazed a trail of light 
- Through murky shadows, with a lithesome tread 
- Unto those forums, where Hope's beams are shed: 
- Straight through the mighty cordon of the night, 
- Rapt with a vision, soul-born, clear and bright. 
- Leaving the South of frigid wrong, she sped 
- Into the North, where hearts glow warm instead, 
- A people's tragedy to there recite. 

- Hope's liquid pipings lift their tender lay, 
- Morning is waking, flushed with rosy gleam. 
- Night with its shadow winds with yesterday 
- Adown the world-way as an inky stream. 
- Seed time and harvest deftly interplay. 
- And Life's fruition is its vital dream! 


---

## TO MAY HOWARD JACKSON — SCULPTOR 

- You saw the vision in the face of clay, 
- And fixed it through the magic of a hand 
- Obedient unto the will’s command, 
- In forms impervious to Time's decay: 
- Historian of bloods that interplay 
- Confusedly within a cryptic land, 
- You've chiseled, and your work of art shall stand 
- To gem the archives of a better day. 

- Alone, far from the touch of kindred mind, 
- You've mounted with a grim, determined zeal. 
- Despite environment austere, unkind. 
- Or frozen-fingers clenched to your appeal. 
- You've held the ardor of your first ideal. 
- Robed in a queenly majesty, resigned. 

---

## TO THE MEMORY OF INEZ MILHOLLAND 

- Folded in silent veils of sleep, 
- {:.indent-3}You calmly rest, 
- For God hath spoken, should we weep? 
- {:.indent-3}He knoweth best. 

- But rather let us garner still 
- {:.indent-3}While yet we may, 
- And meet you in His Holy Hill 
- {:.indent-3}On that Great Day! 

---

## TO ATLANTA UNIVERSITY — ITS FOUNDERS AND TEACHERS 

- Pass down the aisle of buried years to-night, 
- And stand uncovered in that holy place 
- Where noble structures lift their hallowed height 
- Beneath a bending Heaven's chaste embrace, 
- The fruit of those who scorned the path of ease, 
- To buckle on the armaments of care 
- Like to the Son of Man Himself, were these 
- Who gave themselves for brother men — less fair. 

- Before the blinding footlights of to-day 
- We man our parts within Life's tragic play, 
- Full mindful of the earnest love and care 
- That keeps eternal watch and vigil there; 
- Nor do they need fair monuments and scrolls — 
- Their memories are deathless in our souls.
